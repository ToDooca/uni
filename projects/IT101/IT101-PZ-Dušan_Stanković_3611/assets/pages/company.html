					<h2>About the company</h2>
					<h3>Toyotaâ€™s mission is to be the most respected and successful enterprise, delight customers 
						with a wide range of products and solutions in the automobile industry with the best people 
						and the best technology.</h3>
					<p>
						Toyota Motor Corporation is a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in
						Toyota City, Aichi, Japan. In 2017, Toyota's corporate structure consisted of 364,445 employees
						worldwide and, as of September 2018, was the sixth-largest company in the world by revenue. As
						of 2017, Toyota is the world's second-largest automotive manufacturer. Toyota was the world's
						first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year which it has
						done since 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200-millionth vehicle. As of July
						2014, Toyota was the largest listed company in Japan by market capitalization (worth more than
						twice as much as #2-ranked SoftBank) and by revenue.
					</p>
					<p>
						Toyota is the world's market leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, and one of the largest
						companies to encourage the mass-market adoption of hybrid vehicles across the globe. Toyota is
						also a market leader in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. Cumulative global sales of Toyota and Lexus
						hybrid passenger car models achieved the 10 million milestone in January 2017. Its Prius family
						is the world's top selling hybrid nameplate with over 6 million units sold worldwide as of
						January 2017.
					</p>
					<p>
						The company was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda in 1937, as a spinoff from his father's company
						Toyota Industries to create automobiles. Three years earlier, in 1934, while still a department
						of Toyota Industries, it created its first product, the Type A engine, and its first passenger
						car in 1936, the Toyota AA. Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under five brands,
						including the Toyota brand, Hino, Lexus, Ranz, and Daihatsu. It also holds a 16.66% stake in
						Subaru Corporation, a 5.9% stake in Isuzu, as well as joint-ventures with two in China (GAC
						Toyota and Sichuan FAW Toyota Motor), one in India (Toyota Kirloskar), one in the Czech Republic
						(TPCA), along with several "nonautomotive" companies. TMC is part of the Toyota Group, one of
						the largest conglomerates in Japan.
